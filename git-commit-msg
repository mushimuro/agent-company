feat: implement execution coordination, quality gates, and PM wizard

Added comprehensive task execution pipeline with approval workflows, dependency management, and AI-powered project decomposition:

- **Backend**:
  - Implemented ExecutionCoordinator service to orchestrate task execution lifecycle with state management.
  - Added Celery tasks for async execution (execute_task_async) with WebSocket progress broadcasting.
  - Enhanced Attempt model with quality metrics tracking (code_quality, test_coverage, security_score).
  - Built dependency graph utilities (DependencyGraph, topological_sort) for task ordering validation.
  - Extended local_access with approval workflows, quality gate enforcement, and enhanced audit logging.
  - Added comprehensive API endpoints for attempts, approvals, rollbacks, and dependency analysis.
  - Configured requirements.txt with all Python dependencies (celery, channels, etc.).

- **Frontend**:
  - Created execution feature module with ApprovalPanel, DiffViewer, LiveLogViewer, and QualityGatesPanel components.
  - Implemented PMWizard for AI-assisted project decomposition using PM Agent integration.
  - Added TaskDetailModal with full execution controls and dependency visualization.
  - Built DependencyGraph component with interactive node rendering using React Flow.
  - Added useAttempts and usePMDecomposition hooks for execution and decomposition flows.
  - Enhanced useWebSocket with quality gate events and approval notifications.
  - Extended API clients with attempts, decomposition, and dependency endpoints.

- **LDA (Local Development Agent)**:
  - Implemented quality_gates service with automated code quality, test coverage, and security checks.
  - Enhanced API routes with diff generation, approval processing, and rollback support.
  - Extended configuration and request schemas for quality gate parameters.

- **Other**:
  - Updated .gitignore to protect sensitive agent data and LDA artifacts.

This commit delivers Phase 3 (Execution Engine) and Phase 4 (Quality Gates) functionality with 5,435+ lines added across 39 files.
