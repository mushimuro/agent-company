feat: implement real-time task execution pipeline and local access management

Integrated key components for automated task handling and secure local environment interaction:

- **Backend**:
  - Implemented Attempt model and API in apps/attempts to track agent task executions.
  - Added local_access app with WritableRoot and AuditLog for managing filesystem permissions and tracking LDA operations.
  - Enhanced ProjectViewSet with detailed task statistics and TaskViewSet with Celery-backed execution triggers.
  - Configured Celery and Django Channels (WebSockets) for asynchronous processing and real-time status broadcasting.
  - Refactored LoginView to return full user profile alongside JWT tokens for immediate frontend hydration.
  - Introduced TaskExecutor to manage task lifecycle and WebSocket notifications.

- **Frontend**:
  - Added hooks for task execution (useTasks) and real-time updates.
  - Prepared API client for local access management (localAccess.ts).

- **Documentation**:
  - Significant updates to implementation-checklist.md, marking major milestones across Phases 1-4 as completed.

- **Other**:
  - Updated .gitignore to protect agent-specific directories and documentation.
